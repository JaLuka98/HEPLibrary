% Higgs discovery by ATLAS
% Combination of
% 7 TeV: H->ZZ (4l, llvv, llqq), H->yy, H->WW (lvlv, lvqq), H->tautau (leplep, lephad, hadhad), VH(bb) (Zvv, Wlnu, Zll)
% 8 TeV: H->ZZ->4l, H->yy, H->WW* (evmuv)
% Most of the significance comes from 4l, yy and WW. The mass resolution of 4l and yy is very good, the WW channel is highly sensitive but has a low resolution
% local significance (122-131 GeV) is 5.9sigma, global (110-600 GeV) is 5.1sigma
