% Full Run 2 CMS Higgs pair production search in HH->bbyy (non-resonant)
% observed (expected) upper limit is determined to be 0.67 (0.45) fb, which corresponds to 7.7 (5.2) times the standard model prediction
% -3.3 < kappa_lambda < 8.5 and -1.3 < c_2V < 3.5 at 95% CL (marginalised)
% Also presents kappa_lambda constraints from combination with ttH(yy)
