% Discovery paper for the tau lepton
% 64 events with e+ e- -> e+- mu-+ + at least 2 undetected particles (not possible to conserve energy-momentum with only 1)
% Option that this is e+ e- -> tau+ tau-
% However, additional validation was needed to measure mass and spin of the tau and ensure that the events are not due to D meson pair production
% Half of the Nobel prize in 1995 for Perl
