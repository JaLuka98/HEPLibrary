% In this paper, Wilson formulated gauge theories on a space-time lattice.
% Using an expansion in inverse powers of the bare gauge coupling constant, Wilson demonstrated that lattice gauge theories at strong coupling confine charged states.
% This paper laid the conceptual foundation for understanding the quark confinement phenomenon.
% It showed that large quantum fluctuations of gauge fields at strong coupling can generate a force between charged states which stays constant at arbitrary distances.
% This is a novel type of force, essentially different from the Yukawa force due to exchange of particles which tends to zero at large distances.
