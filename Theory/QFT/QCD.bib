% Development of Bjorken scaling and interpretation of DIS.
% Experimentally observed hadrons behave as collections of virtually independent point-like constituents when probed at high energies.
% Properties of these hadrons scale, that is, they are determined not by the absolute energy of an experiment, but, instead, by dimensionless kinematic quantities, such as a scattering angle or the ratio of the energy to a momentum transfer.
% Because increasing energy implies potentially improved spatial resolution, scaling implies independence of the absolute resolution scale, and hence effectively point-like substructure.
% In Bjorken's picture, the quarks become point-like, observable objects at very short distances (high energies), shorter than the size of the hadrons.

% In this paper, Wilson formulated gauge theories on a space-time lattice.
% Using an expansion in inverse powers of the bare gauge coupling constant, Wilson demonstrated that lattice gauge theories at strong coupling confine charged states.
% This paper laid the conceptual foundation for understanding the quark confinement phenomenon.
% It showed that large quantum fluctuations of gauge fields at strong coupling can generate a force between charged states which stays constant at arbitrary distances.
% This is a novel type of force, essentially different from the Yukawa force due to exchange of particles which tends to zero at large distances.
